Count Trailing Zeroes in Factorial

Given an integer N, your task is to find the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of N.

A trailing zero is a zero that appears at the end of a number. For example, 1000 has three trailing zeroes.

Input: An integer N such that 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^9.

Output: An integer representing the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of N.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5

Output:
1

Explanation: 5! (5 factorial) = 120, which has one trailing zero.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 20

Output:
4
