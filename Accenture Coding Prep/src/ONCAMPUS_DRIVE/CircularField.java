You are working on a project where you need to calculate the area of a circular field for different lengths of the radius. T

However, for practical purposes, the area must always be rounded down to the nearest whole number since the result needs to represent an integer value in square meters.

Write a program that takes different values of ùëô (the radius) as input and returns the integer value of D (the area) by truncating the decimal part.
