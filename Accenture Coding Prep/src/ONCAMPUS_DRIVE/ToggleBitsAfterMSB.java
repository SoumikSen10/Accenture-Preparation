Toggle All Bits After Most Significant Bit (MSB)

You are given an integer n in decimal form. Your task is to toggle all the bits that come after the most significant bit (MSB) in the binary representation of n. The MSB should remain the same.

Input:
A single integer n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^9)

Output:
Print the resulting integer after toggling all bits that come after the MSB in the binary representation of n.

Example 1:

Input:
9

Output:
14

Explanation:
The binary representation of 9 is 1001.
After toggling all bits after the MSB, the result is 1110 which is 14 in decimal.
